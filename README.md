ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Krish Prajapati

I'm a BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications) student with a strong interest in full-stack web development and software application development. I'm passionate about building real-world projects, learning new technologies, and continuously improving my skills.

I'm also enthusiastic about open-source and looking forward to contributing to meaningful projects and collaborating with developers around the world.

Currently, I'm exploring Git and GitHub, and using them to share my work, track my learning journey, and become part of the global developer community.
